# CleanGenix
## Overview
CleanGenix is a full-stack application with a Node.js/Express backend and a frontend (framework not specified here). The backend is set up to connect to MongoDB and provides a basic API structure.

## What Has Been Done

### 1. Project Initialization
- Initialized a new Node.js project with Express for the backend.
- Set up project structure with clear separation for backend and frontend.
- Added `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files like `.env`.

### 2. Backend Setup
- Created `app.js` as the main entry point for the backend server.
- Configured environment variable loading with `dotenv`.
- Connected to MongoDB using a separate config file (`configdb.js`).
- Centralized app configuration in `config/config.js`.
- Set up Express to parse JSON request bodies.
- Implemented a root route (`/`) that returns a health check message.
- Server starts on the port defined in configuration.

### 3. TypeScript Support
- Added TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`) with Node.js type definitions.
- Installed `@types/node` for Node.js type support.

### 4. Version Control
- All files committed and pushed to the remote repository.
- Node modules and environment files are excluded from version control.

## Next Steps
- Implement additional API routes and business logic.
- Set up frontend-backend integration.
- Add middleware for error handling, logging, etc.
- Plan for CI/CD and deployment.

# CleanGenix Project Progress Recap (June 25, 2025)

## Backend (`app.js`)

### Environment Setup
- The project loads environment variables using `dotenv`.
- Express is set up as the web server framework.

### Database Connection
- The app connects to MongoDB using a custom `connectDB` function from `config/configdb.js`.

### Configuration
- Application configuration is loaded from `config/config.js`.

### Routing
- Authentication routes are imported from `routes/authRoutes.js` and mounted at `/api/auth`.
- A root route (`/`) is defined to confirm the API is running.

### Middleware
- Express’s JSON body parser middleware is enabled for handling JSON requests.

### Server Startup
- The server listens on the port specified in the configuration.
- The Express app is exported for testing purposes, following best practices for modularity and testability.

## Documentation & Comments
- The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each section.
- The export of the Express app is documented, highlighting its usefulness for testing and modularity.

## Summary of Today’s Work
- Set up the main Express application structure.
- Connected the backend to MongoDB.
- Integrated authentication routes.
- Added middleware for JSON parsing.
- Established a root endpoint for health checks.
- Ensured the app is exportable for testing.
- Maintained clear, descriptive comments throughout the code.

## Next Steps (Suggested)
- Expand authentication logic in `authControllers.js`.
- Add more routes and middleware as needed.
- Implement frontend-backend integration.
- Write tests using the exported app.
